While the dataset does not specify external causes, this behavior is typical of sectors highly dependent on global commodity prices.\nDeflationary Trends: Several divisions experienced periods of deflation (negative inflation), most notably Communication at -5.48% and Clothing and footwear at -4.45%.\nRelative Stability: In contrast, sectors like Education and Health maintained positive inflation rates throughout the entire decade, with minimums above 1.1% and relatively narrow ranges compared to other categories.\nSynchronized 2021 Peaks: A key finding is the inflationary surge toward the end of the study period. Nearly half of the categories (5 out of 12) reached their maximum historical inflation in 2021."

This dramatic drop visually confirms the sector’s extreme sensitivity to external shocks, likely tied to global energy price collapses during that year.\nSector Divergence: While Transport shows high volatility, the other selected divisions—such as Food and non-alcoholic beverages (Division 1) and Clothing and footwear (Division 3)—exhibit much smoother trajectories with less drastic annual swings.\nConvergent Recovery: Toward the end of the period, there is a clear upward trend across multiple lines. The Transport sector, in particular, shows a steep recovery from its 2020 pandemic low (-4.45%) to its peak in 2021.\nConsistent Mid-Period Stability: Between 2016 and 2019, most selected divisions showed a period of relative stabilization, with inflation rates hovering closer to the overall mean of 1.65% before the disruptions of the final two years."

For public policy, this highlights these sectors as primary candidates for “economic safety nets,” as they are highly susceptible to global supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand.\nResilient Categories: In contrast, sectors like Food and non-alcoholic beverages and Recreation and culture experienced only 2 years of deflation, indicating they are more resistant to price drops and generally follow a more stable inflationary path.\n\nThis “Deflationary Map” allows analysts to prioritize sectors that might require intervention during economic downturns, identifying Communication and Transport as the most structurally sensitive areas within the CPI."

Defining Economic Fingerprints (Feature Engineering)\nBy summarizing 11 years of data into three key dimensions—Trend (Average Inflation), Uncertainty (Volatility), and Vulnerability (Deflation Frequency)—we define a unique “economic fingerprint” for each sector.\nWhile individual trends provide historical context, they do not explicitly show how different sectors cluster together based on systemic risk. In this bonus chapter, we use Machine Learning (K-means Clustering) to group CPI divisions into Risk Profiles. This allows policymakers to move from analyzing 12 separate lines to managing 3 or 4 strategic economic groups.\n\n\nCode\n# Feature Engineering: Summarizing 11 years into 3 behavioral metrics\ncpi_features &lt;- inflation_joined |&gt; \n  group_by(description) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_inf = mean(inflation),\n    volatility = sd(inflation),\n    deflation_count = sum(inflation &lt; 0)\n  )\n# Displaying the matrix for analysis  \ncpi_features |&gt; \n  knitr::kable(\n    col.names = c(\"CPI Division\", \"Avg Inflation\",\n                  \"Volatility (sd)\", \"Deflation Frequency\"),\n    align = \"lccc\",\n    digits = 2,\n    caption = \"Table 3.

Leveling the Playing Field (Data Scaling)\nMachine Learning algorithms are sensitive to scale. Without normalization, the model would over-prioritize Deflation Frequency (ranging from 0 to 7) over Average Inflation (often &lt; 1%). Scaling ensures each metric contributes equally to the final risk profile by centering the mean at 0 and setting the standard deviation to 1.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters\nWe use the Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS) to identify the “elbow”—the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly reduces the variance within each group. For a policy analyst, this step is crucial to ensure the resulting categories are distinct enough to be actionable without over-complicating the strategic framework.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123)\n# Testing k from 1 to 6 to find the point of diminishing returns\nwss &lt;- map_dbl(1:6, function(k) {\n  kmeans(cpi_norm |&gt; select(-description), centers = k, nstart = 20)$tot.withinss\n})\n# Plotting the results to visualize the \"elbow\"\ntibble(k = 1:6, wss = wss) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = k, y = wss)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Elbow Method for Optimal K\",\n    x = \"Selecting k = 3 as the ideal balance between model complexity and group distinctness\",\n    y = \"Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

The Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS) measures group compactness, identifying the inflection point where additional clusters provide diminishing returns in variance reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Running the K-means Model (k = 3)\nBased on the Elbow Method analysis, we select k = 3 as the optimal number of clusters. This configuration allows for a clear segmentation of the economy into three distinct risk profiles: Stable, Volatile, and Deflationary-prone sectors, providing a manageable framework for policy intervention.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(123)\n# Executing k-means with the optimal 3 centers\nfinal_kmeans &lt;- kmeans(cpi_norm |&gt; select(-description), centers = 3, nstart = 20)\n# Compiling the model results with the original feature data\ncpi_results &lt;- cpi_features |&gt; \n  mutate(cluster = as.factor(final_kmeans$cluster))\n# Visualizing the preliminary cluster assignment for each sector\ncpi_results |&gt; \n  select(description, cluster) |&gt; \n  arrange(cluster) |&gt; \n  knitr::kable(\n    col.names = c(\"CPI Division\", \"Cluster\"),\n    align = \"lc\",\n    caption = \"Table 5.

Comprising essential services like Health and Education, this group is characterized by high stability and zero deflation frequency. While some sectors, like Education, show a downward trend in inflation (disinflation), they remain predictable pillars of the index.\nCluster 2: The High-Volatility Outlier. Transport stands alone due to its extreme volatility (7.24), which is significantly higher than any other division. This sector represents the primary source of systemic uncertainty for the CPI.\nCluster 3: Structural Deflation Risk. This group includes Communication and Clothing, sectors that frequently experience price drops but with moderate volatility. They represent competitive or technology-driven markets where deflation is a recurring feature rather than a crisis symptom.\n\n\n5. Visualizing the Policy Risk Matrix\nThis final visualization summarizes the behavioral segmentation of the economy. By plotting Volatility against Average Inflation, we can clearly distinguish between stable pillars, technological deflationary sectors, and high-risk volatile categories. The size of each point reflects its Deflation Frequency, adding a third dimension of vulnerability to the analysis.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cpi_results, aes(x = avg_inf, y = volatility, color = cluster)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = deflation_count), alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = description),\n    size = 3,\n    force = 2,            \n    max.overlaps = 20,    \n    box.padding = 0.5,    \n    show.legend = FALSE   \n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"1\" = \"#0072B2\", \"2\" = \"#D55E00\", \"3\" = \"#009E73\"), \n    name = \"Risk Profile\",\n    labels = c(\"1: Stable Anchors\", \"2: Volatile Outliers\", \"3: Deflationary-prone\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 8)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Policy-Driven Risk Segmentation\",\n    subtitle = \"Strategic grouping identifies Transport as a systemic outlier and isolates structural deflation in competitive sectors\",\n    x = \"Average Annual Inflation (%)\",\n    y = \"Volatility (Standard Deviation)\",\n    size = \"Deflation Years\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Macroeconomic Risk Matrix. This multi-dimensional analysis segments CPI divisions based on average inflation, volatility, and deflation frequency (bubble size), providing a comprehensive risk landscape for the 2011-2021 period.\n\n\n\n\nThe model successfully identifies Transport (Cluster 2) as a systemic anomaly due to its extreme volatility (7.24), despite sharing a similar deflation frequency with more stable groups. Cluster 1 represents the “Economic Anchors” like Education and Health, which provide stability with zero deflation years, while Cluster 3 captures sectors like Communication and Clothing that experience structural price drops within a manageable volatility range."

Communication and Furnishings experienced price drops in over 50% of the studied years, suggesting technology-driven or competitive market efficiencies.\nMacroeconomic Stability Anchors: Essential services, specifically Education and Health, were validated as the “Anchors of the Economy.” These sectors maintained zero deflation years and high predictability, even during periods of broader market fluctuations.\nBehavioral Risk Profiles: Using K-means clustering, the economy was successfully segmented into three actionable risk profiles: Stable Anchors, Volatile Outliers, and Deflationary-prone sectors. This allows for targeted policy interventions instead of “one-size-fits-all” economic strategies."
