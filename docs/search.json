While the dataset does not specify external causes, this behavior is typical of sectors highly dependent on global commodity prices.\nDeflationary Trends: Several divisions experienced periods of deflation (negative inflation), most notably Communication at -5.48% and Clothing and footwear at -4.45%.\nRelative Stability: In contrast, sectors like Education and Health maintained positive inflation rates throughout the entire decade, with minimums above 1.1% and relatively narrow ranges compared to other categories.\nSynchronized 2021 Peaks: A key finding is the inflationary surge toward the end of the study period. Nearly half of the categories (5 out of 12) reached their maximum historical inflation in 2021."

This dramatic drop visually confirms the sector’s extreme sensitivity to external shocks, likely tied to global energy price collapses during that year.\nSector Divergence: While Transport shows high volatility, the other selected divisions—such as Food and non-alcoholic beverages (Division 1) and Clothing and footwear (Division 3)—exhibit much smoother trajectories with less drastic annual swings.\nConvergent Recovery: Toward the end of the period, there is a clear upward trend across multiple lines. The Transport sector, in particular, shows a steep recovery from its 2020 pandemic low (-4.45%) to its peak in 2021.\nConsistent Mid-Period Stability: Between 2016 and 2019, most selected divisions showed a period of relative stabilization, with inflation rates hovering closer to the overall mean of 1.65% before the disruptions of the final two years."

This persistent trend may be driven by rapid technological advancements and intense market competition, suggesting it is a sector where consumers consistently gain purchasing power.\nRecurrent Volatility: Both Transport and Furnishings & Household Maintenance recorded 6 years of deflation. For public policy, this highlights these sectors as primary candidates for “economic safety nets,” as they are highly susceptible to global supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand.\nResilient Categories: In contrast, sectors like Food and non-alcoholic beverages and Recreation and culture experienced only 2 years of deflation, indicating they are more resistant to price drops and generally follow a more stable inflationary path.\n\nThis “Deflationary Map” allows analysts to prioritize sectors that might require intervention during economic downturns, identifying Communication and Transport as the most structurally sensitive areas within the CPI."
